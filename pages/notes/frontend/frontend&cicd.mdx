# Front End CI/CD

## What is CI/CD for Front End Development?

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are crucial for modern front end development. They help ensure that your front end code is consistently built, tested, and deployed with minimal manual intervention. Here's a detailed guide on setting up and optimizing CI/CD for front end projects.

## Key Components of Front End CI/CD

### 1. **Build Process**

Front end build processes typically involve the following steps:
- **Transpiling:** Convert modern JavaScript (e.g., ES6+) to a format compatible with older browsers using tools like Babel.
- **Bundling:** Combine multiple JavaScript files into a single bundle using bundlers such as Webpack, Parcel, or Vite.
- **Minifying:** Reduce the size of your JavaScript and CSS files to improve loading times.
- **Optimizing Assets:** Optimize images and other static assets for faster load times.

Example Build Command:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. **Testing**

Testing is essential to ensure that your front end code works as expected. Common types of front end tests include:
- **Unit Tests:** Test individual components or functions in isolation. Popular tools include Jest and Mocha.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify that multiple components work together as expected. React Testing Library is commonly used for this purpose.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test the entire application flow from the user's perspective. Tools like Cypress and Selenium are used for end-to-end testing.

Example Test Command:
```bash
npm test
```

### 3. **Deployment**

Deploying a front end application typically involves:
- **Static File Hosting:** Deploy static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to a CDN or web server. Common platforms include Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automate the deployment process so that changes are automatically deployed when code is pushed to a repository.

#### Example Deployment with Netlify

1. **Setup Redirects:**
   Add a `_redirects` file to your `public` directory with the following content:
   ```
   /* /index.html 200
   ```

2. **Build the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   Install the Netlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install netlify-cli -g
   ```
   Deploy your site:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```
   For production deployment:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

#### Example Deployment with Vercel

1. **Build the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
   Deploy your site:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   Follow the prompts to complete the deployment.

### 4. **CI/CD Configuration**

Integrate your front end project with a CI/CD service to automate the build, test, and deploy processes. Popular CI/CD tools include:
- **GitHub Actions:** Automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository.
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Integrated with GitLab for continuous integration and deployment.
- **CircleCI:** Provides CI/CD pipelines for various environments.
- **Travis CI:** Popular for continuous integration and deployment with GitHub projects.

Example GitHub Actions Workflow:
```yaml
name: Front End CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        run: npm install netlify-cli -g && netlify deploy --prod
```

## Best Practices

- **Automate Everything:** Automate builds, tests, and deployments to reduce human error and improve efficiency.
- **Use Feature Branches:** Implement CI/CD pipelines for feature branches to ensure code quality before merging into the main branch.
- **Monitor Builds and Deployments:** Set up notifications and monitoring to stay informed about the status of your builds and deployments.
- **Keep Your Pipeline Fast:** Optimize your CI/CD pipeline to reduce build and deployment times.

By following these practices and utilizing the appropriate tools, you can streamline your front end development process, improve code quality, and ensure smooth deployments.
