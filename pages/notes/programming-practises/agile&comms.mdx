# Agile & Communication Workshop

## Agile Working Practices

Agile methodologies emphasize _collaborative teamwork_ and _adaptability_ over rigid processes and documentation. The focus is on how team members interact, adapt to change, and collaborate to deliver value incrementally.

### **Kanban Board**

A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage and optimize workflow. It helps teams visualize their work, limit work-in-progress, and enhance flow.

**Key Features:**

- **Columns:** Typically includes columns such as 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'. Custom columns can be added to fit specific needs.
- **Cards:** Each card represents a task and may include details like due dates, assignees, and difficulty level.
- **Work In Progress (WIP) Limits:** Limits on the number of tasks in each column to ensure focus and reduce bottlenecks.

**Benefits:**

- Provides a clear visual representation of the team's workflow.
- Helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

### **Stand-Up/SCRUM**

A Stand-Up meeting is a short, daily meeting where team members quickly update each other on their work. Standing up during the meeting encourages brevity and keeps the discussion focused.

**Format:**

1. **Work Update:** Each team member shares what they’ve accomplished since the last meeting.
2. **Next Steps:** Each member outlines what they plan to work on next.
3. **Blockers:** Discuss any obstacles or issues that are hindering progress.

**Best Practices:**

- Keep it brief and focused, typically lasting 15 minutes or less.
- Use Kanban boards to discuss task progress and changes.

### **Spiking**

A Spike is an exploratory activity aimed at gaining knowledge to address uncertainties or risks associated with a task. It involves research, design, investigation, or prototyping.

**Purpose:**

- **Reduce Risk:** Understand potential challenges and mitigate technical risks.
- **Enhance Estimation:** Improve the accuracy of story estimates by gaining insights into the complexity or feasibility of a solution.
- **Inform Decisions:** Make informed decisions based on the findings of the spike.

### **Riskiest Assumption Tests (RATS)**

Riskiest Assumption Tests focus on validating critical assumptions and reducing project risks before committing to full-scale development.

**Purpose:**

- **Validate Feasibility:** Test key assumptions to ensure that critical elements of the project are achievable.
- **Assess Viability:** Confirm that the project’s core ideas are viable without developing the entire product.
- **Learn Early:** Identify potential issues and address them early in the development cycle.

**Benefits:**

- Helps ensure that the project is on the right track before significant resources are invested.
- Provides early feedback and helps pivot or adjust the project as needed.
