# Project Management

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

An MVP, or Minimum Viable Product, is the most stripped-down version of your project that you can feasibly present to stakeholders or users. The key characteristics of an MVP are:

- **Essential Functionality:** It contains only the core features necessary to demonstrate the primary value proposition of your app. The MVP should showcase the main concept of your app in a way that is functional and meaningful.
- **Proof of Concept:** The MVP serves as a prototype or proof of concept, showing that your idea is viable and can be used in real-world scenarios. It doesn’t need to be production-ready or feature-complete but should convincingly address the core problem it aims to solve.
- **Focus on Core Value:** Concentrate on delivering the primary function of your app exceptionally well rather than including numerous small features. An app that excels in a single, critical area will generally be more compelling than one with many features but poor execution in its core functionality.

At this stage, you might identify several quality-of-life features that would enhance a full version of your app but are not essential for the MVP. These features can be added in future iterations or versions.

## User Stories

User stories are a crucial tool for defining the MVP. They help you articulate what your users need and expect from your application. Crafting user stories can guide your development process and ensure that the MVP focuses on delivering real value.

**Format for User Stories:**

> As a `<role>`, I want/should/can `<feature>` so that `<benefit>`.

**Tips for Writing User Stories:**

- **Be Specific:** Focus on specific features or functionalities that are essential for demonstrating your app’s core value.
- **Keep It Simple:** Avoid combining multiple features into a single user story. If you find yourself using the word ‘and,’ consider breaking it into separate stories.
- **Prioritize:** Identify and prioritize user stories based on their importance and impact on the core functionality of your MVP.

**Example User Stories:**

- As a user, I want to create an account so that I can access personalized features.
- As a user, I want to send a message so that I can communicate with other users.

## Tech Stack

With your user stories defined, it’s time to determine the technology needed to implement them. Evaluating the tech stack involves:

- **Assessing Existing Skills:** Review your current skill set and identify how it aligns with the requirements of your user stories. Determine if you need to learn new technologies or tools.
- **Researching Technologies:** Explore and select the technologies, libraries, and platforms that best fit your project’s needs. Consider factors like compatibility, ease of integration, and community support.
- **Planning Implementation:** Create a plan for how you will implement each user story with the chosen tech stack. Consider any potential challenges or learning curves associated with new technologies.

## Riskiest Assumption Tests (RATs)

Riskiest Assumption Tests (RATs) are critical for validating the feasibility of your MVP. They focus on the most uncertain or complex aspects of your project, helping to mitigate risks before fully committing to development.

**Steps for Conducting RATs:**

1. **Identify High-Risk Features:** Determine which features of your MVP involve new or uncertain technology. For instance, if you are unfamiliar with mobile development or real-time messaging, these are high-priority areas for testing.
   
   **Example:**
   - Developing a mobile app: New territory for the team.
   - Implementing real-time messaging: Requires new technology or libraries.

2. **Perform Spikes:** Conduct exploratory research and small-scale experiments (spikes) to test these high-risk areas. The goal is to confirm whether these features are technically feasible and to understand the effort involved.
   
   **Example Spikes:**
   - Build a basic mobile app that displays a static "Hello World" message.
   - Implement a simple real-time messaging feature in a web application.

3. **Validate Feasibility:** Ensure that the spikes prove the feasibility of each critical feature. If the spikes are successful, you have demonstrated that these components are achievable and can be integrated into your MVP.

4. **Integrate Findings:** Once RATs are complete and you have validated the feasibility of your core features, proceed with the full development of your MVP, incorporating the lessons learned from the spikes.

By focusing on these steps, you can confidently move forward with your project, knowing that the most critical elements have been tested and validated.

## Moving Forward

After completing the RATs and finalizing your MVP, you can start the actual development phase. The MVP will serve as the foundation upon which you can build additional features and enhancements in future iterations, based on user feedback and further testing.

Keep iterating and improving, and use the insights gained from the MVP and RATs to guide the development of a more comprehensive and feature-rich application.
